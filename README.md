# cs300analysisanddesign

- What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  Building different data structures (vectors, linked list, etc.) and reading CSV files
  
  
- How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  I approached the problem as I do most problems in general. I broke down the problem into manageable parts and then went from there, completing each separate task and then putting it all together when I was completed. 

  
- How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
For me, taking breaks and going for walks really helped me to clear my head and then come back to view the problem from a new/differnt perspective.

- How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  It helped me in the sense that it felt like a more "real world" problem. My coding projects thus far have been self-imposed things that I struggled to have motivation with to finish. 


- How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Much like the last problem, it helped me to create a coherent program and maintain the code to be readable and consistent throughout the program.
